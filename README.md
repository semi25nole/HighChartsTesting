# HighChartsTesting

This was put together from the advice of Gordon. Basically what this is intended for is HighCharts practice paired with TDD.
I think the best idea is to choose a chart of your choice, create a branch off develop and do your thing. Feel free to grab the data from anywhere you choose, we can create a mock api call if we'd like. I threw in hardcoded mock data for the first test. I will update with styling and mock api calls in the future.
